# Endless Wombling! High Bullshit!

It's not a thing yet I just made this as a place to pull from.

The plan is simple:

* Make a bare bones polysynth that's abstract as all buggery
* Make an inbetween layer for input that takes keyboard for testing and other fun things
* Add the fun things in the form of switches
* move the whole party to the Pi
* change the switches to a multiplexed hand based doobley which is fingered a bit like a concertina
* add a fully fledged screenless daw with effects and a microphone in

The last point is probably the easiest part idk.
